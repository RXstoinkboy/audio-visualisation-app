# AUDIO VISUALISATION APP

```
https://codesandbox.io/s/quirky-booth-z3v7g
```

This is an app built with HTML5 Canvas, and Web Audio API. It's main purpose is to visualise frequency change of played audio.

I provided there very basic and simplistic controls provided by HTML5 Audio.

It could be easily customized with custom buttons and sliders, but I have mainly focused on audio visualisation.

There is no build system used, mostly becasue I had to work on in `codesandbox.io` which is great, but it didn't feel enough to setup webpack in it.

As for architectural solution, I have mainly modularized functions to keep whole code a little bit cleaner and avoid storing everything in one file.

Music used from `bensund.com`

## USAGE

If you are using `codesandbox.io` you just have to use it's basic `preview` functionality.

As I assume based on `package.json` you have to run: `npm start` in order to run the app.
